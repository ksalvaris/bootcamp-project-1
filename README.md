## Movie Forecast Description
Our project is titled 'Movie Forecast' and functions to allow a user to input their preferred suburb/city into a search bar, which then outputs weather forecast information for the upcoming 5 days. The user can then choose the day/date they are interested in seeing a movie (based on whether the weather is appropriate), and the available showtimes will then be shown to the user to review.
